# ✅ Understanding Dependency Injection in FastAPI (With Annotated)

This README helps you understand **Dependency Injection (DI)** in FastAPI using `Annotated`.  
You’ll learn what it is, why it’s useful, and how to use it with easy and clean code examples.

---

## 💡 What is Dependency Injection?

Dependency Injection means:  
> “Don’t create things inside your function. Ask FastAPI to give them from outside.”

This makes your code easier to read, test, and reuse.

---

## 🤔 Why Should We Use Dependency Injection?

Without DI:
- You write everything inside the function.
- The code becomes harder to maintain and test.

With DI:
- FastAPI gives the required data or logic automatically.
- You can share logic across multiple routes.
- You can easily test by replacing real logic with mock values.

## 🔗 What is Coupling?

**Coupling** means how much one part of the code depends on another.

- **Tightly Coupled**: Everything is connected directly — hard to test or change.
- **Loosely Coupled**: Things work independently — easy to manage.

Using Dependency Injection helps keep code **loosely coupled**.

## 🧾 What is `Annotated`?

FastAPI supports using `Annotated` from Python’s typing system.

### ✅ What does Annotated do?

- Combines type hint and dependency in one line.
- Makes code cleaner and easier to understand.
- Recommended in FastAPI v0.95+ and above.

### 🔤 How does it look?

```python
from typing import Annotated

def read_data(data: Annotated[str, Depends(my_function)]):
```


# 📦 Benefits of Using `Annotated` in FastAPI

✅ Cleaner and more readable syntax
✅ No confusion with default values
✅ Works better with IDE auto-complete
✅ Officially recommended in new FastAPI versions

# 💭 Where to Use Dependency Injection in FastAPI
# You can use DI with Depends and Annotated in:

`Authentication (token checking, logged-in user)`
`Database connections (DB sessions)`
`Third-party services (like Stripe, Firebase, etc.)`
`Configuration/settings injection`
`Pagination, sorting, filtering`
`Reusing logic in multiple routes`


# ✅ Final Words
# Using Annotated with Depends makes your FastAPI code:

✨ Shorter
✨ Smarter
✨ Easier to manage
